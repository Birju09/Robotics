The Trilateration.py contains the code for calculating the point location using the distance of that point from known locations. This python code can calulate the points x,y,z location from 'n' given locations. 
To run the code, a '.txt' file is required containing the data in the format (x,y,z,d), where x,y,z are the co-ordinates of the Beacons and 'd' is the location from the beacon to unkown point.
The data should be in the following format
x1 y1 z1 d1
x2 y2 z2 d2
The code takes the file name as the argument
